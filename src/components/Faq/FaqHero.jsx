    question: "What happens in a Discovery Session?",
    answer: `The Discovery Session is a complimentary, no-pressure call to explore your goals, motivations, and challenges. 
    You’ll learn about our coaching approach, ask questions, and see if our program aligns with your needs. 
    If there’s a fit, we’ll discuss the next steps and pricing. 
    It’s an open conversation designed to help both of us understand if we’re the right match before any commitment.`,

    question: "What is the difference between Life Coaching and Mentoring?",
    answer: `Life Coaching, as practiced through the A.W.A.K.E.N. Model™, is a structured, client-led journey focused on self-awareness and growth. 
    Coaches guide through powerful questioning and accountability — empowering clients to find their own answers.  
    Mentoring, on the other hand, is advice-driven — sharing lessons from personal experience. 
    At JaGoCoach, we emphasize discovery over direction, helping clients awaken their own wisdom.`,
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: "Why should I choose JaGoCoach as my Life Coaching partner?",

    Yet, the real power lies in resonance. 
    If our energy and philosophy align, we’ll co-create your growth journey. 
    If not, we’ll gladly help you find the coach who’s right for you. 
    Book a Discovery Session — no pressure, just possibility.`,

    question: "Is my information kept confidential and private?",
    answer: `Yes. All client information is protected under the principles of confidentiality set forth in the Association for Coaching Code of Ethics. 
    No details are disclosed without written consent. 
    However, note that coaching isn’t a legally privileged relationship like therapy or law. 
    Your data is stored securely, and your privacy is always respected.`,
